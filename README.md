### FAQ?

Running into `node-gyp` build issues?

```shell
$sudo rm -f $(xcode-select --print-path)     #removes the xcode cli tools path you currently have installed.

$xcode-select --install                      #should force the promt to reinsall CLI tools to appear if it doen't show up automatically.
```

Add static files in the static folder. Files in this directory will be copied directly to `dist` folder during build. For example, /static/robots.txt will be located at https://yoursite.com/robots.txt.

This file should be deleted.

if you are going to use node > 16 for development; you have to use the following command to use the legacy ssl for node.
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
